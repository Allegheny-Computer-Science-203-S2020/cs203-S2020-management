# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

  Elicit the requirements for the software project by talking to the customer(s), the student technical leaders and instructor. Determine the features that would be needed to create a fully functional version of the requested software to formulate the software project requirements. Analyze each requirement and how it fits into the overall scope of the project. Break down the requirements into sub-requirements if necessary and prioritize them. Document the requirements for the software project on GitHub in the Issue Tracker or elsewhere if necessary, such as within the README or in Pull Requests. The process of eliciting, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for the software project should actively continue throughout the project, not just at the beginning, as things oftentimes change during the software engineering process.

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
