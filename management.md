# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

  Identify and list skills that are relevant to the project, such as skills for
  resolving issues with GitHub workflow, debugging, problem-solving, and markdown
  skills. Each team member will assess their skills with “Assessment Guidelines”
  and identify areas they are experts in, areas they do not have much experience
  with, and skills they would like to practice and improve. Project managers are
  responsible for keeping track of who is good at what, but team members must
  also be communicative and open to volunteering.

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
