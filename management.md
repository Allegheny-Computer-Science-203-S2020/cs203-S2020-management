# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

  Team members should look at incidents as a learning opportunity. So, blame and
  judgment is intended to be eliminated from the process of resolving project
  mistakes. - Marisol

  The team should take on the postmortems as problem that is everyone's
  responsibility to solve. We will recognize these problems without assigning
  blame to a singular person, which will allow us to more quickly implement a
  solution. The postmortem could be brought up through a Github issue tracker
  where we can discuss the nature of the problem and the potential solution.
  By also bring the postmortems to everyoneâ€™s attention it will allow us to pool
  our expertise and devise a solution that will solve the problem, and hopefully
  prevent related problems to the postmortem. - Jordan B.

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
