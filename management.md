# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

  - Finding Defects:

    In order to find the defects in a software project,
    first check the error
    messages terminal. Secondly, if there still are
    effects, check the test
    cases and asses their correctness. Lastly,
    check TravisCI to see which
    part of the program does not pass the checks. Also check GitHub peer
    reviews since a classmate might be able to catch a mistake that
    slipped by.

  - Report:

    There are many tools that software engineers
    use to communicate and report
    any bugs, errors, or defects in the project. Each tool has a different
    purpose, and benefit for using it. GitHub
    issue trackers and pull request
    threads can be great ways to point out issues,
    review code, and suggest
    new changes. On the other hand,
     Slack work-spaces can also help in direct
    communication through group chats and channels designated to specific
    topics. All of these tools combined
    would greatly help us communicate and
    report our progress as well as issues we face.

  - Fix:

    Finding defects is an important part of getting your
    code to work smoothly. The first step is doing
    some research to try to find a solution. This
    research can be found online or in a book. The second step is
    asking fo help to a classmate, technical
    leader, and instructor. This could be very useful
    because they might know your defect in your code.
    The last step is trial and error with
    the help of test cases. Sometimes just messing
    around with your code you can figure out defects.
    Also, using test cases will help
    guideline where the error is located.

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the software project?
