# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

  The frequency of updates and demonstrations will be largely dependent upon the
  intended audience and partially dependent on the scale of said updates.
  Updates should be delivered relatively frequently in order to encourage
  adherence to deadlines as well as maintain cross-team structure. Ideally,
  lesser updates delivered within individual teams should be delivered once or
  twice a week from assigned team members, while requests for team feedback
  concerning the professor and teaching assistants should be delivered roughly
  once every two weeks. Demonstrations should likely also be made for faculty
  outside of this course, as the products of this class are being developed with
  the intent of their distribution for use by the Computer Science department.
  These demonstrations should be made every two to three times a project depending
  on faculty concerns.


- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
