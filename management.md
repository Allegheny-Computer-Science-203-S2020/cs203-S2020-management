# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

  If a feature is unable to be implemented, the team should research and discuss
   alternative resolutions. If the team makes the decision that there are no
   feasible alternative solutions, team members need to be able to move forward
   on implementing other promised features. It is better to fully implement some
   promised features than only partially implement all features. However, be
   aware that the team should do research at the beginning of the project to
   decide if a feature is feasible. Team members should follow the GitHub Flow
   model to communicate with each other during the process of resolving the
   unimplementable feature.

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
