# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

  The first step to ensure that the session is run efficiently will be to
  have a quick planning meeting with all the team leaders in order to develop
  an actionable strategy for meeting and achieving the project's requirements.
  This will involve a clear, detailed breakdown of which team is responsible
  each project requirement, as well as creating and sharing tentative
  completion deadlines for each section. 

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
