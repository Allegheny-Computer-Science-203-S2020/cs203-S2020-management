# Project Management Plan for Team-Based Software Engineering

## Questions to Answer for Team-Based Software Engineering

- How will you inventory the skills of team members to determine who is
  suited for specific tasks?

- How will you divide the entire team into sub-teams assigned to complete
  specific tasks?
  - Specify tasks that need to be completed

    When dividing the entire team into sub-teams, the first step is realizing all
    the tasks that need to be accomplished. This includes making an expansive list
    of tasks and taking care not to overlook details even if they seem unimportant.

  - Divide tasks into categories of labor

    Once a comprehensive list of tasks exists, the next step is to divide these
    tasks according to category of labor. The distribution of tasks should be as
    even as possible while remaining accurate.

  - Divide team into categories of labor
    Once tasks have been divided accordingly, it will be possible to divide the
    team into sub-teams to complete tasks. Each sub-team should contain members
    with different skills so that groups can divide their assigned labor accordingly.
    For example, each group should have a `Project Manager` that is able to oversee
    group operations and communicate with other group managers. This will allow
    for lateral communication and provide each group with the power of the entire
    team through the responsibility of each person to communicate outside the group
    according to their skillset.

  - Assign tasks to team members by category
    After the division of teams, it is time to distribute the tasks into each group.
    This should be accomplished by assigning each group to a whole category so that
    the group will be internally responsible for the oversight of that category
    of labor. This will speed of the process of production as teams will have greater
    autonomy over handling tasks within a category.

- How will you ensure everyone has the opportunity to master all software
  engineering skills?

- How will you run the course sessions to ensure that you use them
  to maximum effectiveness?

- When and how frequently will you give demonstrations of the software that
  you are engineering?

- How will you adjust the project's schedule if the team falls behind on the
  completion of tasks?

- How and when will your team conduct blame-less postmortems to resolve
  project mistakes?

- How will your team elicit, analyze, and document the requirements for the
  software project?

- What will your team do if it determines that it cannot feasibly implement
  promised features?

- What is your team's software development and testing process for creating
  new features?

- What process will the team follow to find, report, and fix defects in the
  software project?

- How will your team know when it is finished with the implementation of the
  software project?
