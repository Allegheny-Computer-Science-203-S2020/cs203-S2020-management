# cs203-S2020-management

This repository contains the management guide for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2020](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2020/). The students and
instructor will add this management guide to a new GitHub Classroom repository
each when the software engineering team is completing an assignment. Team
members and project managers should refer to this guide during the completion of
the long-term software projects.

## Documenting the Project Management Structure

During the Spring 2020 semester, you will work in an entire-class team to
design, implement, test, document, deploy, and use two large-scale software
applications. During each week of the semester, you will work with your team on
tasks for one of these projects. 

## Problems with the Management Plan

If you have any problems with this management guide, then please create an issue
in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site. Before this
assignment is submitted by the due date, all the issues in this repository
should have been assigned to a team member, discussed, handled, marked as
resolved, and then closed.
